         <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
         The virus is typically spread during close contact and via respiratory droplets produced when people cough or sneeze. 
         Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, social distancing 
         (maintaining physical distance from others, especially from those with symptoms), 
         covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or inner elbow, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.
         The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019â€“20 coronavirus outbreak a 
         Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. 
         Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in many countries across all six WHO regions.</p>
