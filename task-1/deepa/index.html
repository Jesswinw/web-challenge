                The 2019â€“20 COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by
                severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in
                Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization
                (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 25 March, more than 428,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in
                more than 190 countries and territories, resulting in more than 18,900 deaths and more than 109,000
                recoveries.

                The virus is typically spread during close contact and via respiratory droplets produced when people
                cough or sneeze. Respiratory droplets may be produced during breathing but the virus is not
                considered airborne. It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface and then their
                face. It is most contagious when people are symptomatic, although spread may be possible before
                symptoms appear. The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically around five days, but may
                range from two to fourteen days. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of
                breath. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no
                known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment. Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive
                therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing,
                maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they
                are infected. <br> <br>
